# Project Overview

This API will provide the necessary data for your programs to read and write inputs, outputs, variables and so on to our T3000 environment running on the Application server. 

This API will work as a middleware between the client and the controllers in your system so the client will interact with it to send commands to the controllers

## How it works

The API should be installed on a Rasbperry Pi ( or any other computer ) and this computer will be connected to the controllers via a local network so the client will be able to interact with the controllers by reading/writing to the API. 

In order for a client to read and write to the system, the first step is .to install this API on a computer in your system network, in the next section you will see how you can install the API.
